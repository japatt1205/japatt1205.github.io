## Pupfinder App

This project was created for individuals seeking dogs in the Seattle area. This application scrapes 6 different sources, searching for any newly listed dogs. When a new dog is found it is instantly pushed as a Slack notification. This program was cloud hosted and run every 5 minutes using Python Anywhere.
