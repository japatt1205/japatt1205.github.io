## Bounty Streamer

I've been helping as a PM on Bounty Streamer. Bounty Streamer is a Twitch add-on to help streamers engage with their audience while earning donations. Viewers click on a custom overlay, which takes them to a page where they can submit a bounty such as "win the next game". The viewer submits a donation using Pay Pal, and if the streamer completes the bounty they receive the donation.

This project was created to turn Address is into Latitude Longitude coordinates. By uploading a csv with a column titled "Address" it can convert Addresses into their corresponding geographical coordinates.

## Pupfinder App

This project was created for individuals seeking dogs in the Seattle area. This application scrapes 6 different sources, searching for any newly listed dogs. When a new dog is found it is instantly pushed as a Slack notification. This program was cloud hosted and run every 5 minutes using Python Anywhere.
